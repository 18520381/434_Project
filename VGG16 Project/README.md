![alt text](https://github.com/18520381/434_Project_10/blob/main/VGG16%20Project/PNG/VGG16.png)

- It is also called the OxfordNet model, named after the Visual Geometry Group from Oxford.
- Number 16 refers that it has a total of 16 layers that has some weights.
- It Only has Conv and pooling layers in it.
- Always use a 3 x 3 Kernel for convolution.
- 2x2 size of the max pool.
- Has a total of about 138 million parameters.
- Trained on ImageNet data
- It has an accuracy of 92.7%.
- it has one more version of it Vgg 19, a total of 19 layers with weights.
